TODO: Create a benchmark feedforward NN (1-2 layers) and dataset(s) to test verification and analysis.

## New questions
- How to translate a feedforward NN into an optimization problem?
  What is the overall picture of how this works?

- How does the Integer Linear Program (ILP) algorithm for verification work?


- How does structure (e.g. banded structure, sparsity, PSD) in the layer weight matrices affect verification?
