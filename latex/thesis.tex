% Based on sample files of unknown authorship.
%
% The San Francisco State University LaTeX thesis template is
% derived from the UC Berkeley LaTeX thesis template. 
%
% The current maintainer of this work at San Francisco State University is Robert Browder.
%
% A healthy alternative to working directly in LaTeX is to use the thesisdown or bookdown package with R Studio.
% Thesis down provides the opportunity to embed executable code within the narrative flow of your document.
% Thesis down provides both PDF and HTML output.  
%
% This is the main file for this template
%
% This file is where authors may customize title, author, degree semester, degree year, degree, 
% chair, other members, and major.
%
% This file issues the commands to include each part of the document, 
% Pre-formatted parts available - abstract, preface, acknowledgments, introduction, chap1, chap2, 
% and references
% Any part can be omitted by commenting out its "include" command
% Authors may also rearrange the order of contents and add additional chapters using the mark-up examples provided

% Use the graphix package with dvipdfmx when exporting to HTML to preserve figure dimensions for JPG and PNG file types. 
% For this to work you must first create an .xbb file for each file using the following command from the CLI
% ebb -x Picture2.jpg
% \usepackage[dvipdfmx]{graphicx}

% Use the graphix package without dvipdfmx when exporting to PDF
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{rotating} % provides sidewaystable and sidewaysfigure

% To compile this file from the command line, run "latex thesis", then "biber thesis"
% (or "bibtex thesis", if the output from latex asks for that instead),
% and then "latex thesis" (without the quotes in each case).
%
% Alternatively, use Overleaf, MacTeX, or MikTeX to compile to PDF.
%
% To compile this file to HTML from the command line, run 
%  make4ht -f html5+mjcli thesis.tex "mathjax"
% this step requires Nodes.js, MathJax, and mjcli.js to be installed and working on your machine
